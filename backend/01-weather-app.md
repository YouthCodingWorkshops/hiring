# Challenge 1: Weather App

* Technologies: Python, NWS Weather API
* Tests: Required
* Documentation: Required, in a `README.md` file

Your goal in this challenge is to develop a simple command line application in Python that interfaces with the NWS weather API (which is completely free to use and doesn't require signing up). 

Here are the basic requirements:
A user should be able to easily interact with your application, meaning you need to make user input. They should be able to see:
- Current temperature
- Current conditions
- Min temperature for the day
- Max temperature for the day
- Chance of precipitation (rain)
- Calculated average temperature for the first 12 hours

Feel free to go as in-depth as you like. Make note of the features you implemented and wanted to implement, along with ones that aren't working as intended. **For ones that are buggy, describe the problem and what steps you've taken so far to solve it.**

#### Reminders

1. Make sure to have proper error handling
2. Include tests

Good luck!
